# Forecasting methods on pag 40

Loading in the ausbeer data from fpp package

```{r}
data(ausbeer)
head(ausbeer,10) # notice its a time series class of frequency 4.
window(ausbeer,start = 1992, end = 2006-.1) # Why 2006.1, why not end with 2005?; try it!!
window(ausbeer,start = 1992, end = 2005) # notice it includes the q1 of 2005

beer2 <- window(ausbeer,start = 1992, end = 2006-0.1) # works with 0.1 as well :) 
```

# Naive methods

## Average method

Average method lugs in the mean for every forecast.

Let's forecast to the horizon of 11 as in the book

```{r}
meanforecast <- forecast::meanf(beer2,h = 11)
# what is the class of the response - a list
names(meanforecast)
plot(meanforecast)
```

# Naive forecast

Uses the last value as the forecast

```{r}
naiveforecast <- forecast::naive(beer2,h=11)
plot(naiveforecast)
```

# Seasonal naive

Plugs in the last year same quarter figure as the forecast.

```{r}
seasonalNaive <- snaive(beer2,h=11)
plot(seasonalNaive)
```

# Drift method

This method fits a straight line with the slope being the average difference between subsequent points. 

```{r}
DriftMethod <- forecast::rwf(beer2,h=11,drift = T)
plot(DriftMethod)
```

we can't see much of a drift in this data set.

# How does the different methods compare graphically and numerically

```{r}
# the forecast are named means in the output variable

plot(meanforecast,PI = F)
lines(naiveforecast$mean, col = "red")
lines(seasonalNaive$mean, col = "grey")
lines(DriftMethod$mean, col = "green")
```


```{r}
dj2 <- window(dj, end = 250)
plot(dj2)
meanmethod <- forecast::meanf(dj2,h=42)
naivemethod <- forecast::naive(dj2,h =42)
seasonnaivemethod <- forecast::snaive(dj2,h = 42)
driftmeth <- forecast::rwf(dj2, h = 42, drift = T)

plot(dj2,xlim=c(0,292))
lines(meanmethod$mean,col = "grey")
lines(naivemethod$mean, col = "red")
#lines(seasonnaivemethod$mean, col = "blue")
lines(driftmeth$mean, col = "green")
legend("topright", legend = c("Mean method", "Naive method", "Drift Method"), col = c("grey","red","green"), lty = 1,cex = 0.5)

acf(driftmeth$residuals[-1])
```

# Transformations

Let's look at the elec data set.

```{r}
data("elec")
plot(elec)
plot(decompose(elec,type = "additive"))
plot(decompose(elec,type = "multiplicative"))
```
